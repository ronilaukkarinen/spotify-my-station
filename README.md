## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Last.fm account with API access
- Spotify account with API access
- A Spotify playlist to update

## Setup

### 1. Virtual Environment Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. API Setup

#### Last.fm API
1. Go to https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
2. Create an API account and get your API key and secret

#### Spotify API
1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Create a new app and get your client ID and secret
3. **IMPORTANT**: In "Redirect URIs", add exactly: `https://developer.spotify.com/callback`
   - Click "Add URI" and enter `https://developer.spotify.com/callback`
   - Click "Save" at the bottom of the page
   - This URI must match what's in your `.env` file
   - **Note**: This is Spotify's own testing redirect URI

### 4. Environment Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API credentials:

```env
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
LASTFM_API_SECRET=your_lastfm_api_secret
LASTFM_USERNAME=your_lastfm_username
LASTFM_PASSWORD=your_lastfm_password

SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=https://developer.spotify.com/callback
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=your_spotify_playlist_id

LOG_FILE=/path/to/your/spotify-my-station.log
NUMBER_OF_TRACKS=100
```

### 5. Get Spotify Playlist ID

1. Open Spotify and navigate to your playlist
2. Click "Share" > "Copy link to playlist"
3. Extract the playlist ID from the URL (the part after `/playlist/`)

### 6. First Run Authentication

The script handles Spotify authentication with clear terminal instructions:

**First Run Process:**
1. Script displays an authorization URL
2. Copy this URL and open it in your browser
3. Log in to Spotify and click "Agree" to authorize
4. You'll be redirected to `https://developer.spotify.com/callback?code=...` (Spotify's own page will show an error - this is normal!)
5. **Copy the entire URL from your browser's address bar** (including the `?code=...` part)
6. Paste this URL back into the terminal when prompted
7. Script saves token to `.spotify_cache` for future runs

**Security Note**: Using Spotify's own developer callback URL is completely safe - it's their official testing redirect URI.

**Subsequent runs**: Uses cached tokens automatically (no interaction needed)

## Usage

### Single Run

```bash
python spotify-my-station.py
```

### Automated Runs with Cron

To run the script automatically every hour:

1. Open your crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add this line:
   ```bash
   0 * * * * cd /home/rolle/spotify-my-station && /home/rolle/spotify-my-station/venv/bin/python spotify-my-station.py >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

## Configuration

The script can be configured through environment variables in the `.env` file:

- `NUMBER_OF_TRACKS`: Number of tracks to add to the playlist (default: 100)
- `LOG_FILE`: Path to the log file

## Logging

The script logs all operations to both the console and a log file. Check the log file for detailed information about:
- Authentication status
- Number of tracks processed
- Tracks not found on Spotify
- Error messages

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Issues**: Make sure your API credentials are correct in the `.env` file
2. **Playlist Not Updating**: Verify the playlist ID and ensure your Spotify app has the correct permissions
3. **Tracks Not Found**: Some Last.fm tracks might not be available on Spotify
4. **Permission Errors**: Ensure the script has write permissions for the log file location
