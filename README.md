## Features

- **AI-powered by default**: Uses OpenAI or Google Gemini to create intelligent playlists
- **Genre filtering**: Ban entire genres (like hip hop, rap) from your playlists
- **Smart curation**: Mixes your loved tracks with AI-recommended discoveries
- **Automatic updates**: Designed to run via cron job scheduling
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logs with timestamps
- **Clean playlist management**: Removes existing tracks before adding new ones

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Last.fm account with API access
- Spotify account with API access
- A Spotify playlist to update
- **OpenAI API key OR Google Gemini API key** (required for AI features)

## Setup

### 1. Virtual environment setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. API setup

#### Last.fm API

1. Go to https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
2. Create an API account and get your API key and secret

#### Spotify API

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Create a new app and get your client ID and secret
3. **IMPORTANT**: In "Redirect URIs", add exactly: `https://developer.spotify.com/callback`
   - Click "Add URI" and enter `https://developer.spotify.com/callback`
   - Click "Save" at the bottom of the page
   - This URI must match what's in your `.env` file
   - **Note**: This is Spotify's own testing redirect URI

### 4. Environment configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API credentials:

```env
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
LASTFM_API_SECRET=your_lastfm_api_secret
LASTFM_USERNAME=your_lastfm_username
LASTFM_PASSWORD=your_lastfm_password

SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=https://developer.spotify.com/callback
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=your_spotify_playlist_id

# AI API credentials and configuration (required)
AI_PROVIDER=openai  # Options: openai, gemini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # Also accepts OPEN_AI_API_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

LOG_FILE=/path/to/your/spotify-my-station.log
NUMBER_OF_TRACKS=100
```

### 5. Get Spotify playlist ID

1. Open Spotify and navigate to your playlist
2. Click "Share" > "Copy link to playlist"
3. Extract the playlist ID from the URL (the part after `/playlist/`)

### 6. First run authentication

The script handles Spotify authentication with clear terminal instructions:

#### First run process

1. Script displays an authorization URL
2. Copy this URL and open it in your browser
3. Log in to Spotify and click "Agree" to authorize
4. You'll be redirected to `https://developer.spotify.com/callback?code=...` (Spotify's own page will show an error - this is normal!)
5. **Copy the entire URL from your browser's address bar** (including the `?code=...` part)
6. Paste this URL back into the terminal when prompted
7. Script saves token to `.spotify_cache` for future runs

**Security note**: Using Spotify's own developer callback URL is completely safe - it's their official testing redirect URI.
**Subsequent runs**: Uses cached tokens automatically (no interaction needed)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python spotify-my-station.py
```

**AI-powered by default!** The script now uses AI (OpenAI or Google Gemini) to create intelligent playlists that mimic Apple Music's "My Station" feature.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes your entire Last.fm loved tracks collection 
- Creates an intelligent mix of familiar favorites and new discoveries
- Learns from your listening patterns and playlist update history
- Balances songs you love with AI-curated recommendations based on your taste

**Mix Strategy:**
- 25% songs from your vast loved tracks collection (spanning different eras and moods)
- 50% tracks from AI-recommended artists based on your taste analysis
- 25% songs from similar artists discovered via Last.fm recommendations

### Custom Playlist

```bash
python spotify-my-station.py --playlist PLAYLIST_ID
```
Updates a specific playlist instead of the default one from environment variables.

### Genre Filtering

Create a `banned.json` file to filter out unwanted genres:

```json
{
  "banned_items": [
    "song:Hello Kitty",
    "artist:Streetgazer", 
    "genre:hip hop",
    "genre:rap"
  ]
}
```

Use the provided `banned.example.json` as a template. Supported prefixes:
- `song:` - Ban specific songs
- `artist:` - Ban all songs by an artist
- `album:` - Ban all songs from an album
- `genre:` - Ban all songs with this genre

### Help

```bash
python spotify-my-station.py --help
```
Shows all available options.

### Automated runs with cron

To run the script automatically every hour:

1. Open your crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add this line:
   ```bash
   # Spotify My Station
   0 * * * * cd /home/rolle/spotify-my-station && /home/rolle/spotify-my-station/venv/bin/python spotify-my-station.py --playlist xxxxxxxxxxx >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

## Configuration

The script can be configured through environment variables in the `.env` file:

- `NUMBER_OF_TRACKS`: Number of tracks to add to the playlist (default: 100)
- `LOG_FILE`: Path to the log file

## Logging

The script logs all operations to both the console and a log file. Check the log file for detailed information about:
- Authentication status
- Number of tracks processed
- Tracks not found on Spotify
- Error messages

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication issues**: Make sure your API credentials are correct in the `.env` file
2. **Playlist not updating**: Verify the playlist ID and ensure your Spotify app has the correct permissions
3. **Tracks not found**: Some Last.fm tracks might not be available on Spotify
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure the script has write permissions for the log file location
